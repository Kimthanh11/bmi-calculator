## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Tailwind-CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

- Build responsive website using mobile-first workflow
- Calculate the BMI(Body Mass Index) in imperial and metric
- Learn Deploying to Vercel

### Continued development

- I just make responsive website for fixed resolution, I want to make the website responsive for various screen sizes and devices
- I can not make the radio buttons like the Figma, so I replace the buttons with images, so I do not have hover for it
